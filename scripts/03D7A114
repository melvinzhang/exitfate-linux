"These plants. They are not getting \n" + 
"enough sunlight. You should put them\n" + 
"closer to the window and give them \n" + 
"more water.\n" +

"@friend of Daniel Vinyard.\n" + 
"@Miss Windsor, the first thing I wanted\n" + 
"@to ask: having worked so closely with \n" + 
"@Mr. Vinyard and Mr. Knight in the past, \n" + 
"@it must've been tough dealing with \n" + 
"@people with such strong personalities.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"I've grown used to it. I've known them\n" + 
"for so long, it's become normal to me.\n" + 
"They can be difficult at times, but \n" + 
"we're still friends. \n" + 
"\n" + 
"@You joined the army before Daniel did.\n" + 
"@Was it Jovian Knight who convinced you\n" + 
"@to sign up?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Yes, he talked to me about it many \n" + 
"times. He felt very strongly about \n" + 
"fighting Almenga, you see. To him, it \n" + 
"was a fight that concerned everyone,\n" + 
"one that had to be won. If it weren't\n" + 
"for him, I don't think either Daniel\n" + 
"or me would have joined the army.\n" + 
"But... after the war, I do think he felt \n" + 
"guilty about pressuring us to join.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@Guilty? \n" + 
"\n" + 
"I think he saw it as just another of his\n" + 
"adventures. Even though we were all \n" + 
"adults, we didn't truly realize what it\n" + 
"meant to fight in a war. There were \n" + 
"times when we almost died, and I think \n" + 
"he felt guilty about that, about putting\n" + 
"his friends' lives in danger. We all \n" + 
"matured a lot during that year.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@I see... but there was still another\n" + 
"@close friend of yours who didn't come\n" + 
"@with you, wasn't there?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Yes... Brunhild was the only one to stay\n" + 
"behind. None of us even considered \n" + 
"asking her. I was raised as a \n" + 
"blacksmith's daughter and spent all my \n" + 
"life around weaponry, but she was\n" + 
"different. She hated fighting, and she\n" + 
"always tried to break up arguments \n" + 
"between us.\n" + 
"When Daniel decided to leave... it was \n" + 
"a difficult time for her. She frequently\n" + 
"sent us letters, always asking if we \n" + 
"were doing fine. I'm sure she was very \n" + 
"lonely during that time. I wonder if...\n" + 
"that was one of the reasons she changed\n" + 
"so much. \n" +

"@normal appearance, you are actually\n" + 
"@a real dragon?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Indeed, I am a silver dragon. This is\n" + 
"merely a temporary form that allows me\n" + 
"to mingle with humans without \n" + 
"attracting attention.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@It's very fascinating. To us, dragons\n" + 
"@are creatures of legend. I never\n" + 
"@imagined they existed for real. Where\n" + 
"@exactly do you come from?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"A land far, far west of here that has\n" + 
"no name in human language. Few of your\n" + 
"kind exist there, and we have little\n" + 
"contact with them.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@I can't help but wonder after meeting\n" + 
"@you though... are there many more \n" + 
"@dragons among us?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"During our long lives, many of us \n" + 
"venture out from time to time, to learn\n" + 
"from other civilizations and keep watch\n" + 
"on the world around us. They exist even\n" + 
"here, I'm certain, but I could not tell\n" + 
"you how many. I have only recently \n" + 
"arrived in order to hunt down a stray\n" + 
"one.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@You're referring to Tiamat?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Red dragons are a troublesome kind. They\n" + 
"are greedy and selfish. Most of them,\n" + 
"however, keep to themselves. Only few,\n" + 
"like her, actively seek to sow chaos.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@Now that Tiamat has been slain, what \n" + 
"@will you do next?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"I've grown curious about the limits of\n" + 
"human strength. I never imagined that\n" + 
"people such as you would be able to \n" + 
"defeat a powerful dragon such as her.\n" + 
"I will spend some time among your kind\n" + 
"in order to better understand humans.\n" +

"@founding members of the Elysium Army.\n" + 
"@Welcome, Ayara. Now, even though you've\n" + 
"@been playing a large role in the army's\n" + 
"@recent history, we actually know very\n" + 
"@little about your background. What\n" + 
"@were you doing before the war began?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Well, I've really just been in the royal\n" + 
"army. I was a soldier in the third\n" + 
"legion, serving under Colonel Vinyard.\n" + 
"That's how I got to know him. \n" + 
"\n" + 
"@Why did you decide to join the army?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"I don't really know! It's just that...\n" + 
"there didn't seem to be a lot of other\n" + 
"things I could do. I'm not smart enough\n" + 
"to go to school, and I grew up in a \n" + 
"very small town. My father taught me to\n" + 
"hunt, so it wasn't like I couldn't do\n" + 
"anything. Well, one time we were at the\n" + 
"capital when we saw an army parade, and\n" + 
"I thought it looked really amazing.\n" + 
"I just decided at that time that I \n" + 
"wanted to become a part of that.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@I guess things didn't really turn out\n" + 
"@the way you were planning.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"You can say that! I still can't believe\n" + 
"I'm here now. So much has already \n" + 
"happened in such a short time. But I'm\n" + 
"proud of it as well! We've really come \n" + 
"a long way.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@If you could go back to the time when\n" + 
"@you decided to follow Colonel Vinyard,\n" + 
"@would you make the same choice?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Of course! Maybe I would've been safer \n" +

"Oh, me? Well, what can I say. I'm the\n" + 
"owner of the Bartolli General Market,\n" +

$data_interview[6] = 
"@Today I'm interviewing Bast Gunwood,\n" + 
"@former major in the State Army and\n" + 
"@chief strategist of the Elysium Army.\n" + 
"@Bast, you have a very high reputation\n" + 
"@within both Kirgard and Zelmony. Is it \n" + 
"@true that you've never lost a battle?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Nope, it's not true, and I'm not going\n" + 
"to lie about it. Anyone who claims he's\n" + 
"never lost a battle is either talking\n" + 
"out of his ass or damn lucky. No one's\n" + 
"born a military genius. The best \n" + 
"strategists are the ones who can learn\n" + 
"from their mistakes.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@You retired from the State Army ten\n" + 
"@years ago. What led you to resign?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"If you know anything about the recent\n" + 
"state of Zelmony you'd know already, but\n" + 
"fine. A decade ago we were involved in\n" + 
"a border war in Highland. The Fairwind\n" + 
"Republic tried to encroach on Cayeskan\n" + 
"territory, the Highland army stepped\n" + 
"in to help them, and were in turn \n" + 
"attacked by the Fairwind army. It was\n" + 
"a very messy war. The Matrech Guard was\n" + 
"sent in, and I was senior advisor to the \n" + 
"general in charge. \n" + 
"Well, opinions in Matrech were split.\n" + 
"The chancellor was wary of agitating \n" + 
"a large neighbour like the republic and\n" + 
"wanted to settle the dispute quickly.\n" + 
"Others saw it at a chance to spread \n" + 
"their influence and advocated anything\n" + 
"from annexing Cayeska to actually \n" + 
"invading Fairwind territory. By the way,\n" + 
"one of the champions for the latter \n" + 
"cause was none other than Governor \n" + 
"Vosch.\n" + 
"Anyway, I came up a plan to sweep the \n" + 
"invading army from Cayeska from the\n" + 
"north and take one of their key ports\n" + 
"as a bargaining tool for a settlement.\n" + 
"It all went wrong when politicians in \n" + 
"Matrech started meddling with our \n" + 
"plans. Different factions would send\n" + 
"their people over to review our plans\n" + 
"and try to change our minds. Officers \n" + 
"were removed from the front and \n" + 
"replaced with more 'agreeable' ones.\n" + 
"As a result of all this, army unity was \n" + 
"lost as it dissolved into cliques of\n" + 
"like-minded people more concerned about\n" + 
"furthering their own goals than \n" + 
"following our overall strategy.\n" + 
"Sure, we won the war, and in Matrech it\n" + 
"was spun as a grand victory, but in \n" + 
"truth, it was a disaster. My plans\n" + 
"anticipated a two to three month \n" + 
"campaign. In the end, it took almost\n" + 
"two years, and ravaged the area. \n" + 
"Highland managed okay, but it seriously\n" + 
"strained our relations with Cayeska,\n" + 
"a former part of the Zelmony Kingdom.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@And that's when you decided to leave.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Yep, that's right. Coming back to the\n" + 
"capital and seeing all those people who\n" + 
"were responsible for the chaos celebrate \n" + 
"our victory as if it were their own \n" + 
"doing, I couldn't take it any longer.\n" + 
"I said goodbye and moved away from\n" + 
"everything.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@Until Daniel Vinyard came to see you.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"I hope he'll be different, like Ryan\n" + 
"used to be before he lost his real \n" + 
"power. So far, he hasn't disappointed \n" + 
"me. I still have hope.\n" +

# === Beau
$data_interview[7] = 
"@Today I'm speaking with Beau, the \n" + 
"@attorney who defended Mr. Vinyard during \n" + 
"@his trial.\n" + 
"@First of all, a few questions about the \n" + 
"@Zelmony justice system. Military and \n" + 
"@civil cases are treated in the same way, \n" + 
"@right?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Yes, that is correct. However, the \n" + 
"sentence may be different, as in the\n" + 
"former case there is the possibility of \n" + 
"demotion or discharge, but this is up to\n" + 
"the judge.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@Have you had earlier experience with \n" + 
"@corruption within the Zelmony justice\n" + 
"@system?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Well, that's a difficult question for \n" + 
"me to answer. Of course there have been \n" + 
"cases where I had my doubts about some \n" + 
"of the evidence produced by the \n" + 
"prosecution, but of course that is not\n" + 
"proof of corruption by itself. I simply \n" + 
"don't have enough information.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"@That means the case against Mr. Vinyard \n" + 
"@must've stood out from the rest.\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Yes, indeed. I believe there must've \n" + 
"been a certain level of desperation \n" + 
"within the prosecution, or rather, those \n" + 
"who wished to influence the trial. As \n" + 
"such, they felt it necessary to go to \n" + 
"extreme lengths. Once a person has \n" + 
"enemies within the justice system \n" + 
"itself, it will be very hard to get \n" + 
"an unbiased trial.   \n" + 
"\n" + 
"@Yes, I understand. Would you have any\n" + 
"@suggestions on how to improve the\n" + 
"@system?\n" + 
"\n" + 
"Well, there are two approaches: from the\n" + 
"bottom up, or from the top down. Lawyers\n" + 
"such as me could do their part by\n" + 
"doing their work properly and reporting \n" + 
"incidents of corruption. In this \n" + 
"situation, however, I believe a\n" + 
"thorough investigation from the top is\n" + 
"necessary to probe those who would \n" + 
"stay out of reach otherwise. This is no\n" + 
"light matter, and would take a very \n" + 
"dedicated commission with a clear \n" + 
"mandate. It's probably impossible in \n" + 
"the current political climate, but \n" + 
"still, I have good hopes for the \n" + 
"future.\n" + 
"\n" +

"contact with the chancellor. I was only \n" + 
"twelve when he suddenly died, and since \n" +

"Both of them originated in the Zelmony\n" + 
"Kingdom. Matrech was the capital of the \n" + 
"kingdom, and so the Matrech Guard were \n" + 
"the main force, setting them apart from \n" +

"backbone of the State Army, and it's \n" +
